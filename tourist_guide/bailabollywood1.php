			<h3>The Red Fort</h3>
			<p>Built by Shah Jahan in 1648, the beautiful Red Fort was until 1857 as the seat of Mughal power. This magnificent structure with its large walls of red sandstone covers an area of ​​more than two kilometers, all of which are shaped like a crown and a seabed. The impressive main entrance is called the Lahore Gate, which faces Lahore in Pakistan, while the even larger Delhi Gate was used by the emperor for ceremonial processions.</p>
			<p>Tourists arrive at the Lahore gate to access the Chhatta Chowk, a bazaar dating back to the 17th century, where items such as silk, gems and antiques can be purchased, along with souvenirs and typical food.</p>
			<p>A great way to see the Red Fort and other sights is to book a day trip to Old and New Delhi. A personal guide and driver will take you to points of particular interest, such as Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, Jama Masjid, the Delhi Gate and the famous Lotus Temple, one of the high points of this almost 9-hour adventure traveling through the city.</p>

			<h3>Gurudwara Bangla Sahib</h3>
			<p>The 18th century Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is the most famous place in Delhi and is next to Connaught Place. The most important features of the complex are its magnificent lake, Sarovar, in the middle, and its iconic golden dome and flagpole. The spacious temple building itself, its art gallery, and a small museum dedicated to the history of the Sikh faith are also noteworthy. <br><br>
            Visitors are always welcomed with an offering in the large Gurdwara kitchen - all that is required is to cover hair and remove shoes (free shoes and socks are provided).</p>

			<h3>The Lotus Temple</h3>
			<p>A beautiful architectural marvel is the Bahá'í House of Worship, also called the Lotus Temple for its nine sides and its majestic main hall. The entire structure, built with white cement and marble, looks as delicate as a lotus bud, surrounded by nine pools that make it glow. Established in 1986, it has since attracted more than 70 million tourists, making it one of the The world's most visited attractions (surprisingly, there are no visible deities, holy images, or icons of worship at this remarkable place of worship).</p>

			<h3>India Gate</h3>
			<p>Like the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Indian Gate or Gateway of India is an impressive monument built to commemorate the Indian soldiers who were killed in the First World War. Beneath the massive structure, an eternal flame burns, and its walls are etched with the names of more than 90,000 soldiers who died in the conflict.<br><br>

            Standing on a red stone base with a shallow dome at the top, occasionally filled with oil (usually only during important birthdays), the structure overlooks the park, an area always busy with crowds of tourists and locals enjoying a picnic or just a relaxing time. One of the best experiences is to contemplate the Gateway of India at night, a totally free activity that will fill you with satisfaction; an unmissable postcard. </p>

			<h3>Jama masjid</h3>
			<p>The Jama Masjid is one of the largest mosques in India and was Shah Jahan's greatest architectural achievement. The beautiful structure, completed in 1658, consists of three entrance gates, four angular towers, and two 40-meter minarets constructed of red sandstone and white marble, attractively alternating in vertical bands. Visitors must climb the South Minaret to enjoy the stunning views of Old Delhi, after which they must visit the large central washing pool (visitors can remove their shoes and clean themselves properly before entering; non-Muslims cannot pray).<br><br>

            One of the most popular places linked to the Jama Masjid is Chandni Chowk, the massive main street of Old Delhi, the market area for shopping and food. Naya Bazaar and Gadodial are particularly interesting and famous spice markets where hundreds of products are displayed, including anise, ginger, different grains, saffron, lotus seeds, pickles and shuttles.</p>

			<h3>Humayun's Tomb</h3>
			<p>Humayun is a beautiful mausoleum made of red marble and red sandstone, set in a beautiful large garden. It is an excellent example of Mughal architecture designed as a prototype of the Taj Mahal. Haji Begum was built in the mid-16th century by Humayun's elder widow to commemorate her husband and around the tomb are lush and formal gardens, including Humayun's barber and Isa Khan's tomb, an excellent example of Lodi Architecture in octagonal shape.

			<h3>Akshardham</h3>
			<p>The splendid Akshardham Hindu Temple, although recently completed (it opened in 2007), appears to be centuries old. This magnificent building of complex sculptures attracts numerous visitors due to its majestic beauty.<br><br>

            The most remarkable aspect of the 43-meter-high key monument includes the rich carvings of creatures, trees, angels, musicians and dancers made of marble and pink sandstone. Especially notable are the 234 ornate pillars that support its nine domes, as well as an imposing stone sanctuary for elephants, the highlight of which is the colossal 3000-ton statue of one of these animals.

			<h3>Purana Qila (The Old Fort)</h3>
			<p>Although often overlooked, Purana Qila (Old Fort) is worth a visit as most tourists go directly to the famous Red Fort in Delhi. With a history spanning some 2,500 years, many of the impressive existing buildings date back to the 1500s, but there is evidence of earlier structures dating back to the 3rd century. In the affairs of the region, the current structure has for centuries played an important role and had a particular influence on the Muslim religion, as evidenced by buildings such as the Qila I-Kuna Mosque, a unique domed cult site built in 1541. The site is two square kilometers long and you can enjoy exploring its thick walls and three huge gates that are especially impressive all night long.<br><br>

            There is also a visit to the 200 acre Mehrauli Archaeological Park with numerous important structures, some of which date back more than 1000 years. The old remains of Lal Kot and more modern evidence of British rule under Queen Victoria are illuminated.</p>

			<p>Rajpath is also considered to be the King's Way and is the famous ceremonial boulevard in New Delhi.

            At the west end of Rajpath is undoubtedly one of Delhi's most majestic buildings, the Rashtrapati Bhavan Home (once the British Viceroy Home), an eclectic mix of business architectural styles comprising 340 diverse style spaces.<br><br>

            The latest Bhavan Rashtrapati Museum, which offers an overview of the house, and the fascinating exhibits of former presidents is especially important.

			<h3>Gandhi Smriti and the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial</h3>
			<p>In Delhi you can find many references to Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi Smriti (Gandhi's Memoirs), a museum located on the property where he was assassinated in 1948, may be the best among the many attractions associated with the famous leader of the Indian independence movement.<br><br>

			<h3>Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum</h3>
			<p>Another political attraction that is of great importance is the Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum, which was located in the former residence of this woman (Indira was the daughter of the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and was not related, although she was a friend of Mahatma Gandhi).<br><br>

Highlights include photographs documenting his life and time as prime minister, personal belongings such as the sari he wore during his assassination, news, and letters.<br><br>

The building is surrounded by an enclosed garden with mature trees and flowering plants, and his path is now a memorial, with a site identified for his murder. Several rooms were dedicated to his son Rajiv Gandhi, murdered in 1991.<br><br>

Indira Gandhi's father, Nehru, is the object of her former residence in the equally interesting Nehru Museum and Planetarium. The museum presents the life and works of the leader, including interesting objects related to the fight for freedom, including his bedroom, his living room and his workshop.

			<h3>Laxminarayan Temple</h3>
			<p>If you can only squeeze in one additional temple on your tour of Delhi, make it the Laxminarayan Temple (Birla Mandir). It is also one of the last in the city. This impressive Hindu shrine was opened in 1939 at the Connaught site by Mahatma Gandhi as a devotion to the prosperous goddess Laxmi (a condition established by Gandhi was dedicated in the shrines to other religions). The sanctuaries opened in 1939. They are spread over nearly eight acres and lush tropical gardens, fountains and sculptures are a pleasure to explore.</p>
